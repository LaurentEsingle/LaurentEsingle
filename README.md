### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am an aspiring Data Engineer who is specializing in cloud technologies, mainly Azure Cloud.

#### As a former Database administrator with programming expertise, I am interested in data processing and building tools to ease that task.

#### My current personal project is an open source tool I built called vQuery. [More information here](https://laurentesingle.github.io/vQuery/)

#### I am looking forward to joining a company, project or team that will leverage my combined knowledge in Databases as well as Python programming.
